### 2. AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION

#### [SEVERITY: High]
**Title:** Weak Password Policy Implementation  
**Location:** /backend/src/controllers/auth.controller.unified.ts  
**Description:** No password strength validation is enforced during registration. The system accepts any password without checking for:
- Minimum length requirements
- Character complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
- Common password dictionary checks
- Password history

**Impact:** Weak passwords increase the risk of:
- Brute force attacks
- Credential stuffing attacks
- Account takeover

**Remediation:**
```typescript
// Add password validation schema
const passwordSchema = z.string()
  .min(8, 'Password must be at least 8 characters')
  .regex(/[A-Z]/, 'Password must contain uppercase letter')
  .regex(/[a-z]/, 'Password must contain lowercase letter')
  .regex(/[0-9]/, 'Password must contain number')
  .regex(/[^A-Za-z0-9]/, 'Password must contain special character')
  .refine(val => !commonPasswords.includes(val), 'Password is too common');
```

#### [SEVERITY: Medium]
**Title:** Development Tokens Exposed in Production  
**Location:** /backend/src/controllers/auth.controller.unified.ts:295-297  
**Description:** Authentication tokens are included in API responses when NODE_ENV is set to development, but this check could be bypassed.

**Impact:** Sensitive tokens could be exposed in logs or response bodies if environment detection fails.

**Remediation:** Remove token exposure entirely or implement stricter environment checks with additional safeguards.

---

### 3. INPUT VALIDATION & SANITIZATION

#### [SEVERITY: High]
**Title:** Weak Input Validation Implementation  
**Location:** /backend/src/middlewares/validation.ts, /backend/src/middlewares/validator.ts  
**Description:** 
- Basic Joi validation is implemented but not consistently applied across all endpoints
- No HTML sanitization for user-generated content
- Missing validation for file uploads beyond basic MIME type checks
- No protection against prototype pollution in JSON parsing

**Impact:** 
- Potential for XSS attacks through unsanitized user input
- SQL injection risks (though mitigated by Prisma ORM)
- File upload vulnerabilities

**Remediation:**
```typescript
import DOMPurify from 'isomorphic-dompurify';
import { z } from 'zod';

// Implement comprehensive validation schemas
const sanitizeHTML = (input: string) => DOMPurify.sanitize(input);

// Apply to all user inputs
const textbookSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string().transform(sanitizeHTML),
  content: z.string().transform(sanitizeHTML),
  // ... other fields
});
```

---

### 4. CSRF PROTECTION

#### [SEVERITY: Low]
**Title:** CSRF Protection Implementation Could Be Strengthened  
**Location:** /backend/src/middlewares/csrf.ts  
**Description:** CSRF protection is implemented but:
- Token store uses in-memory storage instead of Redis in production
- Some critical endpoints are excluded from CSRF protection
- Double-submit cookie pattern is available but not enforced

**Impact:** Potential for CSRF attacks on state-changing operations

**Remediation:**
- Use Redis for token storage in production
- Review and minimize CSRF-exempt endpoints
- Implement SameSite=Strict for all authentication cookies

---

### 5. SESSION MANAGEMENT

#### [SEVERITY: Medium]
**Title:** Session Security Configuration Issues  
**Location:** /backend/src/controllers/auth.controller.unified.ts  
**Description:**
- Session cookies use SameSite=lax instead of strict
- No session fingerprinting implemented
- IP validation is optional and disabled by default
- Session rotation not implemented after privilege escalation

**Impact:** 
- Session hijacking risks
- Cross-site request vulnerabilities

**Remediation:**
```typescript
// Implement session fingerprinting
const sessionFingerprint = crypto
  .createHash('sha256')
  .update(req.headers['user-agent'] + req.ip)
  .digest('hex');

// Use stricter cookie settings
const cookieOptions = {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: true, // Always true in production
  sameSite: 'strict' as const,
  path: '/',
  domain: '.xn--220bu63c.com' // Set explicit domain
};
```

---

### 6. RATE LIMITING

#### [SEVERITY: Low]
**Title:** Rate Limiting Configuration Adequately Implemented  
**Location:** /backend/src/middlewares/rateLimiter.ts  
**Description:** Comprehensive rate limiting is implemented with:
- Redis-backed rate limiting
- Different limits for various endpoint types
- User-based and IP-based limiting

**Positive Findings:**
- ✅ Auth endpoints: 5 requests per 15 minutes
- ✅ AI services: 20 requests per hour
- ✅ File uploads: 50 per hour
- ✅ Password reset: 3 per hour

**Recommendations:**
- Consider implementing CAPTCHA after rate limit triggers
- Add progressive delays for repeated violations

---

### 7. SECURITY HEADERS

#### [SEVERITY: Medium]
**Title:** Incomplete Security Header Implementation  
**Location:** /backend/src/index.ts  
**Description:** 
- Helmet.js is configured but with relaxed CSP policies
- X-Frame-Options only set for specific routes
- Missing headers: Permissions-Policy, Referrer-Policy

**Impact:** 
- Clickjacking vulnerabilities
- Information leakage through referrer headers

**Remediation:**
```typescript
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"], // Remove unsafe-inline in production
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
      connectSrc: ["'self'", "wss://", "https://"],
      frameAncestors: ["'none'"],
    },
  },
  referrerPolicy: { policy: 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin' },
  permissionsPolicy: {
    features: {
      geolocation: ["'none'"],
      camera: ["'none'"],
      microphone: ["'none'"],
    }
  }
}));
```

---

### 8. CRYPTOGRAPHIC PRACTICES

#### [SEVERITY: Low]
**Title:** Good Cryptographic Implementation with Minor Issues  
**Location:** Various authentication files  
**Description:**
- bcrypt with 12 rounds (good)
- JWT secrets properly validated
- Separate secrets for access and refresh tokens (good)

**Issues Found:**
- JWT secret minimum length only 32 characters (should be 256 bits/64 characters)
- No key rotation mechanism implemented

**Remediation:**
- Increase JWT secret length requirement to 64 characters
- Implement key rotation mechanism with grace period

---

### 9. ERROR HANDLING & INFORMATION DISCLOSURE

#### [SEVERITY: Medium]
**Title:** Potential Information Disclosure in Error Messages  
**Location:** Various error handlers  
**Description:**
- Stack traces might be exposed in development mode checks
- Detailed error messages could reveal system internals
- User enumeration possible through different error messages for login

**Impact:** Information disclosure aiding attackers in reconnaissance

**Remediation:**
- Implement generic error messages for production
- Use consistent error messages for authentication failures
- Log detailed errors server-side only

---

### 10. FILE UPLOAD SECURITY

#### [SEVERITY: Medium]
**Title:** Basic File Upload Security Needs Enhancement  
**Location:** File upload handling in backend  
**Description:**
- MIME type validation present but can be bypassed
- No virus scanning implemented
- File size limits set but could be circumvented
- No image reprocessing to remove metadata

**Impact:** 
- Malware upload and distribution
- Storage exhaustion attacks
- Privacy leaks through metadata

**Remediation:**
```typescript
import sharp from 'sharp';
import { promisify } from 'util';
import { exec } from 'child_process';

// Add file content validation
async function validateFileContent(filepath: string, mimeType: string) {
  // Use file command to verify actual file type
  const execAsync = promisify(exec);
  const { stdout } = await execAsync(`file --mime-type ${filepath}`);
  
  // For images, reprocess to remove metadata
  if (mimeType.startsWith('image/')) {
    await sharp(filepath)
      .rotate() // Auto-rotate based on EXIF
      .withMetadata({ 
        orientation: undefined // Remove EXIF data
      })
      .toFile(filepath + '.clean');
  }
  
  // Implement virus scanning
  // await scanForVirus(filepath);
}
```
